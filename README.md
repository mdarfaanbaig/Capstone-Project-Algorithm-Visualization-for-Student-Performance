# Capstone Project: Algorithm Visualization for Student Performance
The proposed system aims to provide a comprehensive visualization platform for five 
fundamental machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic 
Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. These 
algorithms will be demonstrated in the context of analyzing a student performance 
dataset, offering an interactive and educational experience for users interested in 
understanding how these methods work in practice. In addition to the visualization 
component, the project will utilize the trained algorithms to predict future academic 
outcomes of students. It will also produce detailed insights into the factors affecting 
student performance.
